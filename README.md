About the project

This is a project based on the guidelines on the Shopify 2022 Intern application. It is a basic CRUD application which replicates an inventory management system. You are able to create inventory items, edit, view, and delete each of them, as well as view the entire inventory at once. This can be done by using the links in the top navbar or with the links alongside each item in the group view page. This project was creating using Ruby on Rails, with active storage for the image component.

The feature I chose to include from the provided list was allowing image uploads and storing of the image with generated thumbnails.
